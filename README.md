# My own Personal Website

> https://dongyi-guo.top

This is my personal website, mainly used to give employers a brief walk-through of me to hopefully land me a job, but I also want some of my own stuff to be put around here. 

I want to do this by heavily inspired by Luke Smith with [LandChad](https://landchad.net), I appreciate all the beautiful works that have been done by Luke and everyone else.

This website is built and tweaked from a template called [Hyperspace](https://html5up.net/hyperspace) from [HTML5 UP!](https://html5up.net/). I appreciate the work and I recommend to see if they have the right and beautiful works for you.

I used to host my website with services:

* Email Server with openDKIM and spamassassin.
* Matrix Server with Matrix Dendrite.
* Pleroma Server for Twitter-ish service.
* Wireguard Server for... obvious reasons.

I am no longer hosting them because I am now on a AWS Free Tier, being poor does lock away some fun for you. If you are interested please do check [LandChad](https://landchad.net), if you have any other interesting things to deploy and run but not mentioned, please tell me or contribute to [LandChad](https://landchad.net)
